# Deep-RL-MountainCar-v0-Double-DQN


This project consist on using the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), a deep reinforcement learning method, on our envirment "MountainCar-v0".

## MountainCar-v0
A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum
